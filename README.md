### Technologies Used:

- JSX
- HTML
- CSS

- Ruby on Rails

### Current Features and Implementation:



### Features in the Making:

I am excited to continue making improvements to the site!
In the future, I plan to:
- Create user profiles which also hold links and playback options for all of a user's audio content
- Add audio queuing, so that additional audio content is immediately
available for playback
- Implement options for users to add comments and/or favorite cloudcast programs
- Incorporate options for users to add genre tags and metadata to existing audio programs
- Display audio metadata information during audio playback
