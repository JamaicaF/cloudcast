# Cloudcast README

Cloudcast is a fullstack music streaming web application inspired by [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/). Users can upload and listen to radio shows, DJ mixes, podcasts, and other long-form audio content.

Users can:
- Freely access and listen to a variety of streaming audio programming
- Create, update, and delete their own audio programs after creating a personal user account

Cloudcast is and will remain open source.
